    "**Answer:**\n",
    "For my capstone project, I would like to develop a mid-term prediction model for equity markets in both Latin America (specifically Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru) and the United States. My focus will be on forecasting stock returns or index levels over a six-month investment horizon. I am interested in combining traditional technical indicators with macroeconomic variables, particularly each countryâ€™s interest rates and inflation rates, to improve predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to investigate how the interplay between technical signals and local macroeconomic conditions affects market performance, and whether machine learning models can capture these relationships for more robust investment strategies. As a physicist with no formal background in economics, I am motivated to bridge my quantitative skills with financial knowledge, and I look forward to learning more about macroeconomic indicators and their impact on asset prices as I progress through the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential challenges include sourcing reliable macroeconomic and market data for Latin American countries and interpreting the economic context behind the numbers. However, I believe this interdisciplinary approach could yield valuable insights for investors interested in emerging markets and global diversification."
